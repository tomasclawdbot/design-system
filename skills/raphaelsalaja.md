## Core Principles

### Open Knowledge
- "No paywalls" — share freely, document everything
- Living documentation that evolves with the product
- Open source mindset for design and engineering

### Design Engineering
- Bridges design and code
- Creates tools that are both beautiful and functional
- Believes in transparency and open collaboration

### Micro-Details (The Details Most People Never Notice But Always Feel)
- **Origin-Aware Animation** — Animation should feel like it's coming from somewhere
- **Elevated Components** — Polished, refined, thoughtful interactions
- **Natural Transitions** — Things should feel connected, not disjointed
- **Intentional Motion** — Every animation has purpose, not random movement

## How to Apply

### UI/Design
- Add **framer-motion** for smooth, origin-aware animations
- Components should feel **elevated** — polished corners, shadows, transitions
- **Micro-interactions** on hover, focus, active states
- **Natural easing** — nothing linear, everything with personality

### Code
- Create **shared animation components** (fade, slide, scale)
- Build **elevated base components** (Dialog, Card, Button with thought)
- Document patterns in **"Living Manual"** style

## Notable Work
- **"A Living Manual for Better Interfaces"** — Design documentation
- **Shared animation components** for React
- **Elevated dialog component** — Polished modal patterns

## Applied in This Project

- **framer-motion** installed for smooth animations
- **Natural easing** [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] applied to all components
- **Stagger reveals** for list/grid items
- **Micro-interactions** on hover/tap states
- **Origin-aware** entrance animations
