# Design System

> Creates software as art, but never at the expense of function.

A design system built with intention, inspired by 7 thinkers who shape how we think about design, function, and craft.

## Skills

This project uses skill references from Obsidian and external sources:

- **raphaelsalaja.md** — Open knowledge, living docs, no paywalls

## The 7 Thinkers

| Thinker | Principle | Contribution |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| [@ryolu_](https://x.com/ryolu_) | Subtraction First | "What should we NOT build?" |
| [@emilkowalski](https://x.com/emilkowalski) | Micro-Details Matter | "50ms delay max" |
| [@raunofreiberg](https://x.com/raunofreiberg) | Form + Function | Balance beauty with utility |
| [@nandafyi](https://x.com/nandafyi) | Think Slower, Act Fast | Pause on decisions, execute decisively |
| [@joshpuckett](https://x.com/joshpuckett) | Show, Don't Tell | GIFs, before/afters, visual proof |
| [@raphaelsalaja](https://x.com/raphaelsalaja) | Open Knowledge | No paywalls, document everything |
| [@avstorm](https://x.com/avstorm) | Visual Case Studies | Screenshots, brand evolution |
| [@benjitaylor](https://x.com/benjitaylor) | AI as Collaborator | Amplify humans, build agent-friendly tools |

## Core Values

- **Origin-Aware** — Animation should feel like it's coming from somewhere
- **Specific Numbers** — "50ms delay max" not "fast"
- **Living Documentation** — Docs that evolve with the product
- **Open Knowledge** — Share freely, no paywalls

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Built-in (minimal)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Philosophy

> "Obsesses over details that compound, but knows when to stop."

This isn't about adding features. It's about removing everything that doesn't matter and perfecting what remains.
